###Molecular Dynamics###

Molecules are small. Too small to be observed directly, in fact. In order to
overcome this, Molecular Dynamics (MD) can be used to computationally model
whole systems of molecules, like proteins, in atomistic detail. These
models can quantify the time-dependent dynamics of molecules and be used to
sample the free energy landscape of a system. In doing so, MD simulations can
provide insights into the imperceptible mechanisms of protein dynamics and
predict experimental observations.
