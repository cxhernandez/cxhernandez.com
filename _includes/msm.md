### Markov State Models

Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful means of modeling the structure and
dynamics of molecular systems, like proteins. An MSM is essentially a map of
the conformational space a molecule explores. Such models consist of a set
of states and a matrix of transition probabilities between each pair of states.
These states can be thought of as local minima in the free energy landscape
that ultimately determines a moleculeâ€™s structure and dynamics. MSMs enable
researchers to identify key conformational states and can potentially improve
rational drug design.
