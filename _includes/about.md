I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Reality Labs](https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/), working on machine learning to enable [neuromotor interfaces](https://www.meta.com/emerging-tech/emg-wearable-technology/). Previously, I worked at [CTRL-labs](https://dsvw8jmuo45j8.cloudfront.net/), a start-up acquired by Meta.

Prior to that, I worked with [Vijay Pande](https://www.pandelab.org/) at Stanford on statistical modeling and temporal encodings of biomolecular dynamics. My research interests include information theory, causal inference, and representation learning for time-series.
