Research Scientist at
[Reality Labs](https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/), working on machine learning to enable [neuromotor interfaces](https://www.meta.com/emerging-tech/emg-wearable-technology/). Previously, I worked at
[CTRL-labs](https://dsvw8jmuo45j8.cloudfront.net/), acquired by Meta.

Prior to that, I worked with [Vijay Pande](https://www.pandelab.org/) at
Stanford on statistical modeling and temporal encodings of
biomolecular dynamics. My research interests
include representation learning for time-series, causal inference, and
information theory.
