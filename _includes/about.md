I am currently a research scientist at
[Facebook Research](http://research.facebook.com/). My research interests
include representation learning for time-series, causal inference, and
information theory.


Previously, I worked at
[CTRL-labs](http://www.ctrl-labs.com/) using machine learning to enable
[neural interfaces](https://www.wired.com/story/brain-machine-interface-isnt-sci-fi-anymore/).
Prior to that, I worked with [Vijay Pande](http://pande.stanford.edu) at
Stanford on the statistical modeling and generation of temporal embeddings for
biomolecular dynamics.
