I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/), where I develop machine learning systems for [neuromotor interfaces](https://www.meta.com/emerging-tech/emg-wearable-technology/)—recently leading development of gesture recognition models for the [Meta Neural Band](https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-and-neural-band/). Previously, I was an early member of the machine learning team at [CTRL-labs](https://dsvw8jmuo45j8.cloudfront.net/), a neurotechnology start-up acquired by Meta in 2019.

Prior to joining industry, I earned a PhD from Stanford University as an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, working with [Vijay Pande](https://www.pandelab.org/) on statistical modeling of protein motion. My research interests span signal processing and representation learning—with applications from molecular dynamics to brain-computer interfaces.
