I am currently a research scientist at [CTRL-labs](http://www.ctrl-labs.com/),
using machine learning to enable [neural-machine interfaces](https://www.wired.com/story/brain-machine-interface-isnt-sci-fi-anymore/).
My research interests include temporal embeddings, causal inference,
and information theory.


Previously, I worked with [Vijay Pande](http://pande.stanford.edu) at Stanford
on the statistical modeling and generation of temporal embeddings for
biomolecular dynamics.
