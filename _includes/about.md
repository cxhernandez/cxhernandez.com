I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/), where I develop machine learning systems for [neuromotor interfaces](https://www.meta.com/emerging-tech/emg-wearable-technology/)—technology that enables intuitive control by sensing electrical signals from muscle movements. Previously, I was an early member of the machine learning team at [CTRL-labs](https://dsvw8jmuo45j8.cloudfront.net/), a neurotechnology start-up acquired by Meta in 2019.

Prior to my time in industry, I earned a PhD from Stanford University working with [Vijay Pande](https://www.pandelab.org/) on statistical modeling of biomolecular dynamics. My research spans deep learning, signal processing, and representation learning—with applications from molecular dynamics to brain-computer interfaces.
