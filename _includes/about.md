I am currently a Research Scientist at [CTRL-labs](http://ctrl-labs.com)
using [machine learning to enable neural interfaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5aZK2C3ew).
Previously, I worked with [Vijay Pande](http://pande.stanford.edu) at Stanford
on the statistical modeling and generation of embeddings for
complex biomolecular dynamics.
