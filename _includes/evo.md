###Protein Evolution###

Sequence gives rise to function. However, it has become increasingly clear that proteins with wildly different primary structures can yield quite homologous secondary and tertiary structures. For this reason, it is not enough to determine functional residues from just sequence conservation alone. To push foward, novel techniques in bioinformatics, such as statistical coupling analysis, are needed to identify evolved binding sites and protein-protein interfaces. Targeting of such sites could lead to novel drugs that not only fight diseases but whose efficacy is unaffected by mutation of the target proteinâ€” a common problem with antivirals.
